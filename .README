#Implementation of a basic slack-bot in a channel
##Prerequisites:
Slack account & Slack workspace, slack API
ngrok account to run a server
Create a Bot
Add an app at Slack API.
Add features and functionality: bots, permissions to configure what the bot will be able to do (e.g., chat:write, command, chat:history).
Generate a token for the workspace. It creates a signing key and an author token we will need for the environment path. Remember to keep the Slack bot token and Slack signing secret secret!
Start coding
Create a .env file.
Add the Slack bot token and Slack signing secret in the .env file. Keep them secure!
Create a Python file.
Install the required libraries and packages:
pip3 install slackclient (to connect to Slack)
pip3 install python-dotenv (to read from the .env file)
Install any other required libraries by running pip3 install <library_name>
Connect to Slack
Find the environment path and connect to Slack with your tokens.
To make the Slack bot running, you need a server. One possible provider is ngrok.
Create an account on ngrok and set up your personalized token.
Run: ngrok config add-authtoken <token>
Run: ngrok http <your_local_port>
How to use acro-bot:
Our Slack bot is designed to help users understand the meaning of acronyms that are commonly used in their workplace. With the use of simple commands, users can search, add, edit, or delete acronyms and their respective definitions. All commands will trigger the bot to open a direct message (DM) with the user who issued the command. This is where the bot will provide feedback and display the results of the command.

##Command 1: /acro

The /acro command allows users to search for the definition of an acronym. Here's how to use this command:

Syntax: /acro [acronym]

Example: /acro JSON

##Command 2: /acro-add

The /acro-add command allows users to add new acronyms or update existing ones along with their definitions. Here's how to use this command:

Syntax: /acro-add [acronym] "[definition]"

Example: /acro-add JSON "JavaScript Object Notation"

Note: The definition for the acronym should be enclosed in quotes. This is especially important when the definition has multiple words. If quotes are not used, only the first word after the acronym will be saved as the definition.

##Command 3: /acro-delete

The /acro-delete command allows users to delete an existing acronym and its definition from the bot's database. Here's how to use this command:

Syntax: /acro-delete [acronym]

Example: /acro-delete ETA

###Conclusion:
With the help of this bot, users can easily add or update acronyms and their definitions, making it easier for everyone in the workplace to understand the jargon used in their industry. Moreover, this bot's features can be customized to meet the specific requirements of different teams.
